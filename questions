1) The "for" loop provides us a condensed version of the "while" loop 
2) To write a executable "for" loop, we have to first provide the loop with a variable, then provide a condition during which the loop will run, the third specifies the changes that will be incremented to the variable, and lastly we provide the function and the parameters we want it to run it with.
3) Nested loops are the loops that run inside bigger loops.
